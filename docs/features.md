## Feature list (at a glance)

| Area | Features |
|------|----------|
| **Pipeline & stages** | Stage-based pipelines; sync/async groups; **group-level if/elseif/else** (condition plugin + thenGroup/elseGroup/elseif.thenGroup); DAG-capable execution graph; predefined stages (ACCESS, PLANNER, PLAN_EXECUTOR, MODEL, RETRIEVAL, RETRIEVE, TOOL, MCP, MEMORY, EVALUATE, FEEDBACK_CAPTURE, DATASET_BUILD, TRAIN_TRIGGER, MODEL_REGISTRY, etc.); custom and dynamic (JAR) plugins; iterative blocks and plan executor. |
| **Execution & kernel** | Execution-state driven kernel; deterministic ready set; versioned state (stepId, executionId); execution snapshots; interceptor layer (before/after/onError); execution modes (LIVE, REPLAY, DRY_RUN, EVALUATION, BRANCH). |
| **Stage result & contract** | Deterministic StageResult envelope (output, metadata, deterministic, dependencies); StageMetadata & DependencyRef; ExecutionGraph (linear list → graph, topological order); CheckpointableStage (resumeFrom, branchFrom); OutputContract (schema validation, enforceStrict). |
| **Human & signals** | Async pause: stage calls `requestSuspendForSignal()`; workflow awaits; `receiveSignal(ExecutionSignal)` (HUMAN_APPROVAL, MANUAL_OVERRIDE, COMPLIANCE_ACK); resume with payload. |
| **Pipeline break** | Any activity can request to stop the pipeline: return `StageResult` with `requestPipelineBreak=true` or call `context.requestPipelineBreak()`. **SYNC**: first stage that requests break stops the group and pipeline. **ASYNC**: pipeline breaks only when **all** activities in the group request break; until then execution continues. |
| **Streaming** | StreamingStageHandler and StreamObserver (onToken, onUpdate, onComplete, onError); kernel-native streaming for partial tokens and tool output. |
| **Agents & identity** | AgentContext (agentId, persona, AgentMemoryStore); durable agents across sessions; ExecutionContext references AgentContext; command can set agentId/persona. |
| **Determinism & replay** | DeterminismPolicy (freezeModelParams, persistToolOutputs, persistRetrievalResults); randomnessSeed; ContextSnapshot carries policy; NONE/FULL presets for enterprise audit and replay. |
| **Temporal** | Durable workflows and activities; exactly-once execution; retries and timeouts; visibility (UI, event history); long-running and async flows; workflow versioning; signal support for human-in-the-loop. |
| **Enterprise** | Access control, multi-tenancy, rate limits, audit, billing, observability, feature flags, security scanning, caching; guardrails, PII, compliance; human approval and compliance gates. |
| **Feature flags** | Every optional feature has a **FeatureFlag** enum; config lists **enabledFeatures**; only enabled features execute (no code paths for disabled features). Loaded at bootstrap for performance. |
| **Minimal activity state** | **activity.payload** config (maxAccumulatedOutputKeys, maxResultOutputKeys) and guidance to keep workflow/activity payloads small so Temporal history (DB/Elastic) stays minimal. |
| **Policy engine** | **ExecutionPolicyResolver**: central model selection by tenant tier, tool whitelist per user, budget/max-token/max-iteration caps (POLICY_ENGINE). |
| **Budget guardrail** | **BudgetGuardrailEnforcer** + **ExecutionCaps**: kernel stops execution when cost/tokens/iterations exceed caps (BUDGET_GUARDRAIL). |
| **Concurrency isolation** | **QueueTopologyConfig**: queue-per-stage, queue-per-tenant for isolating heavy models and high-cost tenants (CONCURRENCY_ISOLATION). |
| **Security hardening** | **SecurityHardeningGate**: prompt injection defense, tool allowlist, output scanning pre-persist, context poisoning detection (SECURITY_HARDENING). |
| **Plan safety validation** | **PlanValidator**: allowed stages only, max depth, no recursive infinite loops, no unauthorized injection before running dynamic plan (PLAN_SAFETY_VALIDATION). |
| **Graph export** | **ExecutionGraph** exports: toDot(), toMermaid(), toJsonForUi() for DOT, Mermaid, JSON (EXECUTION_GRAPH_EXPORT). |
| **Learning & training stages** | EVALUATE, FEEDBACK_CAPTURE, DATASET_BUILD, TRAIN_TRIGGER, MODEL_REGISTRY; future-ready for incremental learning and model lifecycle; stub plugins provided. |
| **Conditional groups** | At group level: **condition** plugin runs first (writes output key `branch`); then one of **then** / **elseif** / **else** runs; prefer **thenGroup**, **elseGroup**, **elseifBranches[].thenGroup** (group as children). |
| **Config & debugging UI** | **ui-reference.md**: single reference for Configuration UI and Stage Debugging UI (predefined stages table, plugin types, config schema, pipeline structure, activity naming, context keys). |

## Feature flags and minimal activity state

### Feature flags (config-driven)

All optional features are gated by a **FeatureFlag** enum. In the configuration file, set **enabledFeatures** to the list of feature names you want enabled (e.g. `["VERSIONED_STATE", "STAGE_RESULT_ENVELOPE", "HUMAN_SIGNAL"]`). Flags are loaded at **bootstrap**; only enabled features run—disabled features execute no code paths, which helps performance.

**Available flags:** `HUMAN_SIGNAL`, `STREAMING`, `AGENT_CONTEXT`, `DETERMINISM_POLICY`, `CHECKPOINTABLE_STAGE`, `OUTPUT_CONTRACT`, `EXECUTION_GRAPH`, `STAGE_RESULT_ENVELOPE`, `VERSIONED_STATE`, `INTERCEPTORS`, `PLANNER_PLAN_EXECUTOR`, `EXECUTION_SNAPSHOT`, `POLICY_ENGINE`, `BUDGET_GUARDRAIL`, `CONCURRENCY_ISOLATION`, `SECURITY_HARDENING`, `PLAN_SAFETY_VALIDATION`, `EXECUTION_GRAPH_EXPORT`.

When **enabledFeatures** is missing or empty, no optional features are enabled (core pipeline still runs). Add only the flags you need.

### Feature-flag design: bootstrap elimination and minimal runtime check

**Intended design:**

1. **Eliminate execution hierarchy during bootstrap** — For each feature flag, the execution hierarchy (plan shape, registered executors, interceptors, resolvers) should be built **only when the feature is enabled**. Disabled features must not register or build that code path at bootstrap, so they run no code and add no branches in the hot path. Example: if `EXECUTION_GRAPH` is off, the plan is built with linear `stageOrder` only (no graph topology); if `HUMAN_SIGNAL` is off, the workflow/kernel need not register suspend/signal handling in the built hierarchy.

2. **Minimal enum check at root when runtime is required** — If a feature genuinely requires a **runtime** decision (e.g. “after this group, should we suspend for signal?”), the check must be a **single, minimal enum check at root level** (e.g. at workflow entry or kernel loop head), not scattered `isEnabled(FeatureFlag.X)` calls in many executors or activities. That way the feature is eliminated in one place: one branch at the root, and the rest of the pipeline stays feature-agnostic.

**Current practice:** Flags are loaded from config at bootstrap and set on `EngineRuntime` in **SetRuntimeStep**. Plan building uses the flag **EXECUTION_GRAPH** at bootstrap to choose stage order (topological from graph vs linear from `stageOrder`), so that part of the hierarchy is already eliminated at bootstrap. Some features still use runtime checks in executors or workflow; the target state is to move those to bootstrap-time elimination or to a single root-level check where runtime is unavoidable.

### Minimal activity state (Temporal history)

Temporal records workflow and activity input/output in its store (DB/Elastic). To keep history small:

- **activity.payload** in config supports **maxAccumulatedOutputKeys** and **maxResultOutputKeys** (0 = no limit). Use to document or enforce size limits.
- Prefer storing large blobs (e.g. full documents, big model outputs) in external storage and passing only references (keys, URLs) in context.
- Keep **ExecutionCommand.input** and stage outputs lean when possible so activity invocations stay small.

## 2. Qualities of Using Temporal

The worker runs pipeline **workflows** and **activities** on [Temporal](https://temporal.io). That choice delivers the following qualities for AI and enterprise deployments.

### 2.1 Durability & Reliability
- **Durable execution**: Workflow and activity state are persisted in Temporal’s store. Worker or process restarts do not lose in-flight runs; execution resumes from the last decision point.
- **Exactly-once execution**: Activities are executed exactly once per workflow decision. Retries are handled by Temporal so you avoid duplicate LLM calls or duplicate writes when something fails mid-pipeline.
- **Enterprise**: Safe for production; no “lost” requests or double billing when failures occur.

### 2.2 Retries & Fault Tolerance
- **Configurable retries**: Per-activity timeouts and retry policies (max attempts, backoff, non-retryable errors) are set in config. Failed stages (e.g. model timeout, rate limit) can retry automatically without re-running the whole pipeline.
- **Failure isolation**: A failing activity does not corrupt workflow state. The workflow can retry the activity, skip it, or fail the run in a controlled way.
- **Enterprise**: Handles transient failures (network, provider limits) and keeps pipelines predictable.

### 2.3 Visibility & Observability
- **Temporal Web UI**: Every workflow and activity run is visible by workflow ID, pipeline, and task queue. You can inspect event history, inputs/outputs, and failure reasons without adding custom dashboards.
- **Activity types**: Stages are exposed as activity types (e.g. `RETRIEVAL::VectorStoreRetrievalPlugin`, `MODEL::Llama32ModelPlugin`), so you can see which stage ran, for how long, and with what result.
- **Enterprise**: Debugging, SLA monitoring, and audit trails are built into the platform.

### 2.4 Workflow Replay & History
- **Event-sourced history**: Workflows are replayed from a deterministic event history. You can trace exactly what happened in a run and reproduce issues.
- **No “black box”**: The full sequence of stage invocations, timeouts, and retries is stored and queryable.
- **Enterprise**: Compliance, forensics, and support benefit from a complete, replayable history.

### 2.5 Scalability & Decoupling
- **Scale workers independently**: Add or remove worker processes; Temporal distributes tasks via task queues. Pipeline throughput scales with the number of workers and activity pollers.
- **Decoupled workflow and activities**: The workflow (orchestrator) runs in one place; activities (plugins) run in workers. You can scale or isolate heavy stages (e.g. LLM, retrieval) by queue and worker pool.
- **Enterprise**: Horizontal scaling and clear separation between orchestration and execution.

### 2.6 Long-Running & Async Flows
- **Long-running workflows**: Workflows can run for hours or days (e.g. document ingestion, multi-step agentic flows). They do not need to stay in memory; Temporal persists and rehydrates them.
- **Async by design**: ASYNC stage groups run activities in parallel and merge results; the workflow coordinates without blocking.
- **Enterprise**: Batch jobs, approval flows, and human-in-the-loop patterns fit naturally.

### 2.7 Versioning & Safe Deployment
- **Workflow versioning**: Workflow code can be versioned so that in-flight runs continue on the old version while new runs use the new one, reducing deployment risk.
- **Activity versioning**: New plugin versions can be rolled out per task queue or worker pool.
- **Enterprise**: Zero-downtime deployments and controlled rollouts for pipeline and plugin changes.

### 2.8 Summary: Why Temporal Fits This Platform

| Quality            | Benefit for AI / Enterprise pipelines                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Durability         | No lost runs on restart; exactly-once activity execution      |
| Retries            | Automatic retry of failed stages with backoff                 |
| Visibility         | Full run history and stage-level visibility in Temporal UI    |
| Replay             | Deterministic replay and audit trail                           |
| Scalability        | Scale workers and queues; decouple orchestration from plugins  |
| Long-running       | Multi-step and batch pipelines without holding process state  |
| Versioning         | Safe rollout of workflow and plugin changes                    |

### 2.9 Kernel: Execution-State Driven, Deterministic, Graph-Capable, Snapshot-Aware

The pipeline kernel is designed so that execution is **state-driven**, **deterministic**, **graph-capable**, and **snapshot-aware**:

- **Execution-state driven**: Progression is driven by explicit **execution state** (plan + context + set of completed group indices). The kernel advances by computing the **ready set** (groups whose dependencies are all completed) and running one group at a time from that set.
- **Deterministic**: The next group is chosen only from the plan and the completed set (no `currentTimeMillis()`, `Random`, or other non-deterministic APIs in workflow code). This keeps Temporal replay correct and audit trails consistent.
- **Graph-capable**: Plans are not only linear: each stage group can declare **dependencies** on other group indices (`dependsOnGroupIndices`). The kernel runs a group when all its dependencies have completed, so DAG-shaped plans (e.g. run A, then B and C in parallel, then D) are supported.
- **Snapshot-aware**: Execution state can produce an **execution snapshot** (plan, completed indices, context copy) at any time for observability, debugging, or recovery tooling.
- **Immutable versioned state**: Context is **versioned** via `VersionedState` (`executionId`, `stepId`, `state` map, `metadata`). Every stage reads previous state; the kernel merges plugin output and produces **new** state (stepId increments). Sync: stepId + 1 per stage; async group: stepId advances by the number of parallel branches (highest among them). This enables **replay**, **diff**, **time-travel**, and **audit**.

### 2.10 Execution Snapshot Hook: Interceptor Layer (Non-Optional)

A **kernel-level interceptor** layer runs around every stage (not as a stage itself):

- **Before stage**: `beforeStage(StageContext ctx)` — state in `ctx` is the versioned state before this stage.
- **After stage**: `afterStage(StageContext ctx, StageResult result)` — called with the stage output (before merge).
- **On error**: `onError(StageContext ctx, Exception e)` — called when the stage throws.

`StageContext` exposes `executionId`, `stepId`, `groupIndex`, `stageDefinition`, `stateBefore`, `executionMode`, and `pipelineName` so interceptors can snapshot, audit, trace, evaluate, or meter. The chain is **non-optional**: when no interceptors are registered, a no-op chain is used. You can plug in:

- **SnapshotWriter** — persist versioned state for replay.
- **AuditWriter** — write audit log entries.
- **Tracer** — emit spans or metrics.
- **Evaluator** — score outputs (e.g. for evaluation runs).
- **CostMeter** — record token/cost per stage.

- **Enterprise**: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, internal audit trails.

### 3.5 Billing & Metering
- **BILLING** (`BillingPlugin`): token/model/usage metering, cost allocation, showback/chargeback.
- **Enterprise**: internal billing, tenant invoicing, cost attribution.

### 3.6 Observability & Tracing

---

## 4. Pipeline Flexibility Use Cases

### 4.1 Per-Use-Case Pipelines
- Different pipelines per product: `document-ingestion`, `question-answer`, `rag-*`, `llama-oss`, `openai-oss`, `both`.
- Same engine, different stage graphs and plugins.
- **Enterprise**: one platform for ingest, chat, RAG, and internal tools.

### 4.2 Sync vs Async Stages
- **SYNC**: strict order (e.g. ACCESS → RETRIEVAL → MODEL → POST_PROCESS).
- **ASYNC**: parallel execution (e.g. multiple models) with configurable merge (LAST_WINS, PREFIX_BY_ACTIVITY, custom).
- **Enterprise**: latency vs throughput, parallel model comparison.

### 4.3 Custom Stages & Extensions
- **CUSTOM**, **SUB_CUSTOM**, **CustomStagePlugin**: arbitrary logic as a stage.
- **WORKFLOW_EXTENSION** (`WorkflowExtensionPlugin`): extend workflow behavior.
- **Enterprise**: proprietary steps, legacy system hooks, domain logic.

### 4.4 Dynamic Plugins (JAR)
- Load plugins from JARs via config (`dynamicPlugins`); no code change to core.
- **Enterprise**: partner or customer plugins, internal SDKs.
- **Plugin contract:** For a full, self-contained contract to implement and scale plugins (StageHandler, ExecutionContext, StageResult, registration, config, optional streaming/checkpoint/output contract, dynamic JAR), see **[Plugin Contract](plugin-contract.md)**.

### 4.5 Iterative Execution
- **ITERATIVE_BLOCK** + **ITERATIVE_BLOCK_END** with **PLAN_EXECUTOR** inside: run a dynamic plan repeatedly (e.g. refine until good, multi-step reasoning).
- **Enterprise**: loops, retries, adaptive flows.

### 4.6 Execution Control
- **EXECUTION_CONTROLLER**: central place for conditional branching, backoff, or policy (e.g. when to use cache vs live model).
- **Enterprise**: cost/latency policies, failover, fallbacks.

### 4.7 Conditional Groups (if/elseif/else)
- At **group level**: set **condition** to a plugin name (ConditionPlugin). That plugin runs first and must write output key **`branch`** (Integer: 0 = then, 1 = first elseif, …, n−1 = else). Only the selected branch runs.
- **Group as children**: prefer **thenGroup**, **elseGroup**, and **elseifBranches[].thenGroup** (one GROUP per branch); alternatively use thenChildren/elseChildren/elseif.then (lists of nodes).
- Use cases: model selection by context, tenant-specific branches, fallback paths, A/B by condition.
- **Enterprise**: conditional pipelines, cost routing, compliance branches. See [configuration-reference.md](configuration-reference.md) and [ui-reference.md](ui-reference.md).

### 4.8 Configuration UI & Stage Debugging UI
- **[ui-reference.md](ui-reference.md)** is the single reference for building Configuration UI and Stage Debugging UI: predefined stages table (with order and descriptions), plugin types table, config schema at a glance, pipeline structure, activity naming (`stageBucketName::activityName`), context keys (originalInput, accumulatedOutput), and execution flow for run inspection.

## 5. Other Possible Plugins (Iterator, Planner, and Business-Domain)

Beyond the plugin types already in config, the following **possible plugins** map to common business needs and can be implemented as custom or new plugin types in this domain.

### 5.1 Iterator / Iterative Plugins

| Plugin / concept        | Purpose | Business need |
|-------------------------|--------|----------------|
| **IteratorPlugin**      | Drives loop over items (e.g. chunks, pages, list of tasks). Produces one “current item” or batch per iteration; works with **ITERATIVE_BLOCK** and **PLAN_EXECUTOR** for multi-step or per-item plans. | Batch document processing, paginated APIs, “for each” workflows. |
| **BatchIteratorPlugin** | Splits input into batches (by size, token count, or key), runs downstream stages per batch, aggregates. | Large-doc ingestion, bulk embedding, batch inference. |
| **StreamIteratorPlugin** | Iterates over a stream (e.g. SSE, Kafka) and runs a sub-pipeline per event or window. | Real-time processing, event-driven RAG or classification. |
| **RetryUntilPlugin**     | Repeats a stage or sub-plan until a condition (e.g. REFLECTION score, validation) is met or max iterations reached. | Improve-until-good, self-correction loops. |

- **Stages**: Use **ITERATIVE_BLOCK** + **ITERATIVE_BLOCK_END**; iterator plugin in the block can set context (e.g. current batch, cursor); **PLAN_EXECUTOR** inside the block runs the plan per iteration.
- **Enterprise**: Batch ingest, bulk translation/summarization, per-record pipelines, retry-until-valid flows.

### 5.2 Planner Plugins

| Plugin / concept           | Purpose | Business need |
|----------------------------|--------|----------------|
| **PlannerPlugin**          | LLM (or rule engine) that outputs a **dynamic plan** (stages/steps) and stores it in context under `dynamicPlan` for **PLAN_EXECUTOR** to run. | Task decomposition, multi-step reasoning, adaptive workflows. |
| **TaskDecompositionPlugin**| Given a user goal, produces a list of sub-tasks or a plan DAG. | Project breakdown, research pipelines, agentic flows. |
| **WorkflowGeneratorPlugin**| From natural language or structured input, generates a pipeline spec (e.g. which stages, order) that the engine can run. | “Describe what you want” → run it. |
| **RoutePlannerPlugin**     | Decides which pipeline or branch to run (e.g. by intent, topic, or risk). | Intent routing, triage, escalation. |

- **Stages**: **PLANNER** (plugin runs, writes plan to context) → **PLAN_EXECUTOR** (kernel runs plan). In an iterator, this becomes an **iterative plan executor** (re-plan per iteration if needed).
- **Enterprise**: Complex decision trees, compliance workflows, adaptive agents, dynamic routing.

### 5.3 Content & NLP Plugins

| Plugin / concept           | Purpose | Business need |
|----------------------------|--------|----------------|
| **SummarizationPlugin**    | Short/long summaries, extractive or abstractive. | Reports, emails, tickets, meeting notes. |
| **TranslationPlugin**      | Translate text (or segments) with optional locale/glossary. | Multilingual support, localization. |
| **ClassificationPlugin**   | Label content (intent, topic, sentiment, priority, PII level). | Routing, triage, compliance tagging. |
| **ExtractionPlugin**       | NER, entities, key-value, structured fields from unstructured text. | Contracts, forms, invoices, resumes. |
| **EmbeddingPlugin**        | Compute embeddings for chunks or queries (separate from vector store write). | Reusable embeddings, multiple indexes, custom models. |
| **ChunkingPlugin**         | Split documents by strategy (semantic, token, section). | RAG quality, retrieval tuning. |

- **Enterprise**: Document understanding, contact center automation, content moderation, knowledge mining.

### 5.4 Routing, Validation & Control

| Plugin / concept           | Purpose | Business need |
|----------------------------|--------|----------------|
| **RouterPlugin**           | Route request to a pipeline or model by intent, tenant, or feature flag. | A/B, tenant-specific flows, cost routing. |
| **ValidationPlugin**       | Validate input or output (schema, policy, format); reject or correct. | API contracts, guardrails, data quality. |
| **ThrottlePlugin**         | Delay or throttle calls (e.g. to external APIs) per tenant or key. | Rate limits, cost control, fairness. |
| **FallbackPlugin**         | On failure or low confidence, switch model, pipeline, or return a safe default. | Resilience, graceful degradation. |

- **Enterprise**: Reliability, cost control, multi-tenant routing.

### 5.5 Human & Notifications

| Plugin / concept            | Purpose | Business need |
|-----------------------------|--------|----------------|
| **HumanInTheLoopPlugin**    | Pause workflow for approval, review, or correction; resume when human responds (e.g. via signal). | Moderation, approvals, high-stakes decisions. |
| **NotificationPlugin**     | Send alerts, emails, or Slack/Teams messages at a stage (e.g. on failure, on threshold). | Ops, escalation, user notifications. |
| **ConsentPlugin**           | Check or record user consent/preferences before processing. | GDPR, marketing, sensitive data. |

## 7. Stage Result Envelope, Graph, Checkpointing, and Output Contract

### 7.1 Deterministic StageResult Envelope

Stage execution returns a standardized **StageResult**:

- **output** (canonical): `Map<String, Object>` stage output; **data** is deprecated but supported for backward compatibility.
- **metadata**: `StageMetadata` (stageName, stepId, executionId, stageBucketName) for replay and audit.
- **deterministic**: whether the result is replay-safe.
- **dependencies**: `List<DependencyRef>` (executionId, stepId, stageName) for DAG and provenance.

The kernel enriches results with metadata when not set by the handler.

### 7.2 Execution Graph (Future DAG Support)

Execution order is represented by an **ExecutionGraph**:

- **nodes**: `Map<String, StageNode>` (id → node; node has id and stageBucketName).
- **edges**: `Map<String, List<String>>` (node id → successor ids).

**Backward compatibility**: when only `stageOrder` is set in config, a linear graph is built automatically (nodes in order, edges A→B→C). Plan building uses `getExecutionGraphEffective().topologicalOrder()` so a future DAG config will work without code change.

### 7.3 CheckpointableStage (Checkpoint API)

Stages can optionally implement **CheckpointableStage** (in addition to `StageHandler`):

- **supportsReplay()**: whether the stage supports deterministic replay from checkpoint.
- **resumeFrom(stepId, context)**: resume from the given step; returns `StageResult`.
- **branchFrom(stepId, context)**: create a branch from the given step; returns `StageResult`.

**ExecutionCommand** supports **resumeFromStepId** and **branchFromStepId**; the kernel can use these to drive resume/branch and call checkpointable stages accordingly.

### 7.4 OutputContract (Schema Contract Layer)

Stages can optionally declare **OutputContract**:

- **getSchema()**: schema for this stage’s output (e.g. JSON Schema as String or JsonNode).
- **enforceStrict()**: if true, validation failure leads to failure or retry; if false, invalid output may be logged but accepted.

An **OutputContractValidator** can be registered at bootstrap (`EngineRuntime.setOutputContractValidator`). When a stage implements `OutputContract` and a validator is set, the activity layer validates the stage output after execution; if validation fails and `enforceStrict()` is true, an **OutputContractViolationException** is thrown. This enables structured outputs and API-safe LLM responses.

---

## 8. Human Interaction Signal (Async Pause / Resume)

The kernel supports **suspend workflow** and **resume with external signal** for human review, manual override, and compliance gates.

- **ExecutionSignal**: `type` (e.g. `HUMAN_APPROVAL`, `MANUAL_OVERRIDE`, `COMPLIANCE_ACK`) and `payload`.
- **ExecutionContext**: `requestSuspendForSignal()` (stage calls this when it needs human input); `getResumeSignal()` / `setResumeSignal(ExecutionSignal)` (workflow sets after receiving signal).
- **KernelOrchestrator.execute** returns **KernelExecutionOutcome**: `completed` or `suspended` with `suspendedAtStepId`.
- **CoreWorkflow**: `@SignalMethod void receiveSignal(ExecutionSignal signal)`. Workflow awaits signal when outcome is suspended, then injects signal into context and continues kernel (re-run so the stage can read the signal and proceed).

---

## 9. Streaming-Aware Stage API

Stages can optionally implement **StreamingStageHandler** (extends `StageHandler`):

- **execute(context, StreamObserver observer)**: observer may be null (non-streaming). When non-null, implementations call `observer.onToken(String)`, `observer.onUpdate(type, payload)`, `observer.onComplete()` / `onError(Throwable)`.
- **StreamObserver**: receives partial tokens, intermediate updates, and tool streaming output so streaming becomes kernel-native. Default `execute(context)` delegates to `execute(context, null)`.

---

## 10. Agent Identity Layer (Durable Agents)

**AgentContext** provides durable agent identity so agents persist across sessions:

- **agentId**, **persona**, **AgentMemoryStore** (load/save state keyed by agentId).
- **ExecutionContext** references **AgentContext** via `getAgentContext()` / `setAgentContext()`.
- **ExecutionCommand** may set **agentId** and **persona** so the workflow can build and attach AgentContext when creating the execution context.

---

## 11. Determinism Policy Toggle

**DeterminismPolicy** (on **ExecutionCommand** / **ExecutionContext.getDeterminismPolicy()**):

- **freezeModelParams**: when true, kernel/callers should force temperature=0 and lock model params for replay.
- **persistToolOutputs**: when true, tool outputs are persisted and replayed as-is (no re-execution in replay).
- **persistRetrievalResults**: when true, retrieval results are persisted and replayed as-is.

**randomnessSeed** (optional on ExecutionCommand): when determinism is enabled, kernel/store can use this for reproducible randomness. **ContextSnapshot** carries **determinismPolicy** so replay can enforce it. Presets: `DeterminismPolicy.NONE` and `DeterminismPolicy.FULL`. This is key for enterprise audit and replay.

---

## 12. Stage Order (Reference)

Execution order of predefined stages (see also §7.2 Execution Graph):

`ACCESS` → … → `MODEL` → `RETRIEVAL` / **`RETRIEVE`** → … → `POST_PROCESS` → **`EVALUATION`** / **`EVALUATE`** → **`FEEDBACK`** / **`FEEDBACK_CAPTURE`** → **`LEARNING`** → **`DATASET_BUILD`** → **`TRAIN_TRIGGER`** → **`MODEL_REGISTRY`** → `OBSERVABILITY` → `CUSTOM`

Pipelines include only the stages they need; order is defined by `stageOrder` in config. A minimal learning-ready flow can use: **ACCESS** → **MEMORY** → **RETRIEVE** → **MODEL** → **EVALUATE** → **FEEDBACK_CAPTURE** → **DATASET_BUILD** → **TRAIN_TRIGGER** → **MODEL_REGISTRY**.

### 12.1 Learning and training stages (future-ready)

Stages reserved for **incremental learning** and **model learning**:

| Stage | Purpose | Future use |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **EVALUATION** / **EVALUATE** | Score or measure model output (quality, relevance). | Quality gates; trigger learning when score is below threshold. |
| **FEEDBACK** / **FEEDBACK_CAPTURE** | Collect user feedback (ratings, corrections). | Training signal for incremental learning. |
| **LEARNING** | Run incremental learning step. | Fine-tune, update embeddings, or train on new data. |
| **DATASET_BUILD** | Build or curate dataset from feedback/evaluations. | Training dataset preparation. |
| **TRAIN_TRIGGER** | Trigger training job when conditions are met. | Fine-tune, LoRA, or full training runs. |
| **MODEL_REGISTRY** | Register or promote a trained model for serving. | Model lifecycle, A/B, rollback. |

**RETRIEVE** is an alias for **RETRIEVAL** (same semantics). Plugins: implement the corresponding plugin types in `PluginTypes` (e.g. `EvaluationPlugin`, `FeedbackPlugin`, `LearningPlugin`, `DatasetBuildPlugin`, `TrainTriggerPlugin`, `ModelRegistryPlugin`). Stub implementations are provided so pipelines can include these stages today; replace with real implementations for evaluation loops and model learning.

## 13. Policy Engine, Budget Guardrail, Concurrency, Security, Plan Validation, Graph Export

### 13.1 Strong Policy Engine (POLICY_ENGINE)

Policy is **central** via **ExecutionPolicyResolver** instead of distributed across TenantPolicy, Guardrail, and RateLimit plugins:

- **Model selection** by tenant tier
- **Tool whitelist** per user
- **Budget cap**, **max token cap**, **max iteration cap** enforcement

Register a custom resolver at bootstrap (`EngineRuntime.setExecutionPolicyResolver`); default implementation applies no restrictions.

### 13.2 Budget / Cost Guardrail (BUDGET_GUARDRAIL)

**BudgetGuardrailEnforcer** and **ExecutionCaps** provide kernel-level execution caps:

- Stop execution when **cost > threshold**, **tokens > limit**, or **iterations > limit**
- Enforcer resolves caps per run; kernel checks after each stage when the feature is enabled

Register at bootstrap (`EngineRuntime.setBudgetGuardrailEnforcer`).

### 13.3 Concurrency Isolation (CONCURRENCY_ISOLATION)

**QueueTopologyConfig** in config supports queue topology design for scaling:

- **strategy**: `SINGLE`, `QUEUE_PER_STAGE`, `QUEUE_PER_TENANT`
- **stageToQueue**: stage name → task queue (isolate heavy models)
- **tenantToQueue**: tenant id → task queue (isolate high-cost tenants)

Use for queue-per-stage or queue-per-tenant isolation guidance and implementation.

### 13.4 Security Hardening (SECURITY_HARDENING)

**SecurityHardeningGate** interface covers:

- **Prompt injection defense** (before model stage)
- **Tool allowlist enforcement** (before tool stage)
- **Output content scanning** pre-persist (PII, toxicity, policy)
- **Context poisoning detection**

Register at bootstrap (`EngineRuntime.setSecurityHardeningGate`); call from stages or interceptors when the feature is enabled.

### 13.5 Plan Safety Validation (PLAN_SAFETY_VALIDATION)

**PlanValidator** validates dynamic plans from the PLANNER before PLAN_EXECUTOR runs them:

- **Allowed stages only** (no unauthorized stage injection)
- **Max depth** enforcement
- **No recursive infinite loops** (cycle detection)

When enabled, PLAN_EXECUTOR calls `EngineRuntime.getPlanValidator().validate(plan, context)` before executing. Register `PlanValidatorImpl` or custom validator at bootstrap with allowed stage list and max depth.

### 13.6 Visual Execution Graph Export (EXECUTION_GRAPH_EXPORT)

**ExecutionGraph** exports for UI and tooling:

- **toDot()**: Graphviz DOT format
- **toMermaid()**: Mermaid graph format
- **toJsonForUi()**: JSON structure (nodes + edges) for UI rendering

Use when EXECUTION_GRAPH_EXPORT is enabled to improve adoption and debugging.
