Open LLM Orchestrator Worker – Product FAQ

What is the Open LLM Orchestrator Worker?
The worker runs config-driven pipelines (e.g. document ingestion, question-answering) using Temporal. You define pipelines in engine-config.json and trigger them by workflow with a pipeline name and input.

How do I ingest documents for RAG?
Use the document-ingestion pipeline. Send a workflow with pipelineName "document-ingestion" and input containing a "document" field with the text. The pipeline tokenizes the document and stores chunks in the vector store (when implemented).

How do I ask questions over ingested content?
Use the question-answer pipeline. Send a workflow with pipelineName "question-answer" and input containing a "question" field. The pipeline retrieves relevant chunks from the vector store and sends them with the question to the LLM (e.g. Llama 3.2) to produce an answer.

What task queue does the worker use?
By default the worker uses the task queue name from config (e.g. "core-task-queue"). Set QUEUE_NAME in the environment to override in production.

Where is the config loaded from?
Config is loaded in order: Redis, then database, then file (e.g. config/engine-config.json). Connection details (queue, Redis, DB) come from environment variables.
